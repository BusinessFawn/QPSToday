# QPSToday
Connect to the "Pizza Pi" to display current status of QPS


At the Raleigh office of Blackboard Transact, we were looking for a fun way to keep our technicians apprised to the current
status of critical end user systems. We decided, instead of distributing countless emails, correspondence through messages
in paper footballs, or constant inquiry of the person tasked with fixing, we'd make a score board!

Using a TCP/IP connection a user with the QPSToday application can specify and connect to a Rasberry Pi and update 4 rows of 3 
lights with the current status of those services/features.

This project is continuing in it's development.
